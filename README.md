# Aircraft recognition and generation

## 1. Methodology

### 1.1 Multi-class Classification

For the Convolutional Neural Network project (CNN), we used the  Military Aircraft Detection dataset  as specified. Then, for the code itself, we import all the necessary libraries, such as TensorFlow and Keras which contained the models and layers, necessary to train the CNN. We also imported the libraries which allowed us to check the file extension and the treatment of the pictures into an array (NumPy)
